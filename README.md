* **List employees within a department**: Ability to retrieve a list of all employees belonging to a particular department.

#### 3.1.3 Manager Hierarchy

* **Assign managers to employees**: Functionality to establish reporting relationships by assigning a manager to an employee.
* **View an employee’s manager**: Ability to retrieve the manager of a specific employee.
* **View direct reports and recursive subordinates of a manager**: Functionality to list all employees directly reporting to a manager and all employees reporting up to that manager in the hierarchy.

#### 3.1.4 Employee Transactions

* **Log employee lifecycle events**: Ability to record the following transaction types:
    * **Hire**: Records when an employee is hired.
    * **Transfer**: Records when an employee is moved from one department to another, including the previous and new department.

* **Security**:
    * Implement token-based authentication (JWT or DRF Token).
    * Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse.
* **Maintainability**: The codebase should adhere to PEP8 guidelines and follow a modular architectural design for easy maintenance and updates.
* **Reliability**: The system should aim for 99.9% uptime, with proper logging and monitoring mechanisms in place to quickly identify and resolve issues.

    * Query Parameters: Allow filtering by employee\_id, transaction\_type, date range, etc.
    * Response: JSON array of transaction objects.

## 6. Logical Database Design

* Utilize a normalized relational schema to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.
* Implement indexes on `department_id`, `manager_id` in the `Employee` table, and `employee_id` in the `Transaction` table to optimize query performance.
* Consider using soft deletes (adding an `is_active` flag) or archival tables to maintain data integrity and allow for potential data recovery.

## 7. Security Requirements

* Implement token-based authentication (either JWT or Django REST Framework's TokenAuthentication) to secure API endpoints.
* Implement administrative roles to restrict access to sensitive operations such as deleting records and modifying the reporting hierarchy.
* Sanitize all user inputs to prevent common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), although the latter is less relevant for a pure backend API.
* Implement rate-limiting on API endpoints to prevent denial-of-service attacks and abuse.
* Enforce the use of HTTPS for all API communication to encrypt data in transit.

## 8. Performance Requirements

* Implement pagination for all endpoints that return lists of resources (e.g., employees, departments, transactions) to improve response times and reduce data transfer.
* Utilize database indexes appropriately to optimize data retrieval operations.
* Explore the possibility of supporting batch uploads and bulk operations (e.g., via CSV or JSON) for creating or updating multiple records efficiently.
* For hierarchical queries (retrieving recursive subordinates), investigate the use of recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in PostgreSQL or implement caching mechanisms to optimize performance.

## 9. Error Handling & Logging

* All API errors should be returned in a consistent JSON format, including an error code, a human-readable message, and optional details for debugging:
    ```json
    {
      "code": "ERR001",
      "message": "Invalid input.",
      "details": "The email address provided is not valid."
    }
    ```
* Log all API requests (including method, endpoint, and timestamp) and any errors that occur, including timestamps and detailed error information.
* Integrate with monitoring tools like Sentry or Prometheus to facilitate real-time error tracking and performance monitoring.

## 10. Future Enhancements

* Implement an audit trail to track all changes made to employee and department records, including who made the change and when.
* Develop functionality for bulk import and export of data using CSV templates.
* Create a graphical admin dashboard for visualizing organizational structure and managing employee data more intuitively.
* Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for more granular control over API access and operations.
* Develop department-level and organization-level analytics and reporting features.
